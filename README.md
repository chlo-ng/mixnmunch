# A Tool for Generating Concepts: [Mix n Munch](https://mix-n-munch.netlify.app/)
This is a project that I did for the course CS 8803-CDP: Creative Design Practices that I took in Georgia Tech.
The idea was to create a tool that generates concepts utilizing the "art of chance". This means that randomization and letting the generated results be out of both the developer and user's control is highly recommended.

To do that, we were assigned to develop a webpage that loads words or phrases from three categories into a phrase or sentence that expresses a novel idea... **within 10 days**.
  
The learning objectives of this assignment are:
- To quickly get into making
- To explore chance and combinatorics as a source and expression of creativity 

## Technology Stack (v1)
For the sake of simplicity and the fact that we had 10 days, I decided to use:
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- EdamamAPI
